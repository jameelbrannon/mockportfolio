This repository documents a notional, primarily long-oriented portfolio and the fundamental research supporting each position.

The portfolio is expressed on a $1,000,000 notional basis for analytical clarity and does not represent a real-money portfolio.

## Investment Approach

- Fundamental, research-driven
- Primarily long-oriented with selective short exposure
- Focus on businesses with tangible assets and operating leverage
- Valuation-driven, not price-driven
- Concentrated, patient capital
- Willingness to hold cash when opportunities are not compelling

Short positions, when used, are:
- Thesis-driven
- Size-constrained
- Expressed to hedge risk or exploit clear valuation dislocations

No short-term trading. No market timing.

## Portfolio Structure

- Initial position size: 3–5%
- Maximum position size: 10–15%
- Max number of positions: 12
- Cash permitted as a strategic asset

Positions are resized or exited only when:
- The underlying thesis changes
- Valuation becomes extreme
- Risk/reward materially deteriorates
