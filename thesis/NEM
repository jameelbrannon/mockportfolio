I want to buy Newmont because realized gold prices lag spot by roughly ~$916/oz, implying ~$5.3B of incremental revenue and about ~$3B of incremental free cash flow as pricing catches up, and if gold remains above $4,000/oz the company's diversified Tier-1 assets support structurally higher cash generation even with flat production.
